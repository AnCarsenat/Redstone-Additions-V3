# /ra:tools/wrench/try_multiblock
# Try to assemble a multiblock at looked-at position
# Context: as player, at position where looking
# Called when no custom block found by wrench

# Multiblock bases are now custom blocks, so they're handled in found_block

# No multiblock controllers found at this position
